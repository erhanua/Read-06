## 1. What are variables in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. Think of them as containers or storage boxes where you can keep information to be referenced and manipulated throughout your code. Here's a basic overview:

- **Declaration**: Before you use a variable, you typically need to declare it. This tells the JavaScript engine to set aside some memory for the variable.
  ```javascript
  let myVariable;
Initialization: After declaring a variable, you can give it an initial value.

javascript
Copy code
myVariable = 5;
Or you can declare and initialize in one step:

javascript
Copy code
let myVariable = 5;
Data Types: In JavaScript, variables can hold different types of values, such as:

Numbers: let age = 25;
Strings: let name = "John";
Booleans: let isOnline = true;
Objects: let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};
Arrays: let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
and more...
Var, Let, and Const:

var: Historically used to declare variables. It's function-scoped.
let: Introduced in ES6 (ES2015). It's block-scoped and is now the recommended way to declare variables that will change over time.
const: Also introduced in ES6. It's block-scoped and is used to declare variables whose values should not be reassigned.
Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. The type can change during the execution of the program.

javascript
Copy code
let data = 5;       // data is a number
data = "hello";     // now, data is a string
2. What does it mean to declare a variable?
Declaring a variable is like telling the computer, "I'm going to use a name to refer to some data, but I'm not

2. What does it mean to declare a variable?
Declaring a variable is like telling the computer, "I'm going to use a name to refer to some data, but I'm not telling you what the data is yet." It's like setting aside an empty box to put something in later.

javascript
Copy code
let myVariable;       // Declaration
console.log(myVariable); // Outputs: undefined

myVariable = 5;       // Assignment
console.log(myVariable); // Outputs: 5
3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?
At its most basic, the "assignment" operator is the = symbol in programming. It's used to assign a value to a variable. It takes the value on its right and assigns (or sets) it to the variable on its left.

javascript
Copy code
let age = 25;
Here, = is the assignment operator. It assigns the value 25 to the variable age.

4. What is information received from the user called?
Information received from the user is commonly called "input."
